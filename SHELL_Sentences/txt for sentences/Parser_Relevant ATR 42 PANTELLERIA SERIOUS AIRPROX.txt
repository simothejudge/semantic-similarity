E3#1 At 13h52 another Meridiana flight, the aircraft ISS1825 (MD-82) from Palermo to Pantelleria, was being cleared to descend to FL100 by the Rome  controller.
L#

3#2 At 13h52:40 Rome controller firstly authorized ISS1825 to descend to FL 100; then remembering that FL 100 was previously assigned by Pantelleria Tower at aircraft ISS1834 informed ISS1825 to descend and maintain FL 110.
L#

4 This clearance was immediately corrected by the Rome controller to FL110 as result of the previous communication from Pantelleria tower  about the presence of aircraft ISS1834 at FL 100.
