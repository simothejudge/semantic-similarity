## Abstarct
Accidents in aviation are rare events. From them, aviation safety management systems take fast and effective remedy actions by performing the analysis of the root causes of accidents, most of which are proven to be human factors. Since the current standard relies on the manual classification performed by trained staff, there are no technical standards already defined for automated human factors identification. This paper considers this issue, proposing machine learning techniques by leveraging the state-of-the-art technologies of Natural Language Processing. The techniques are then adapted to the SHEL standard accident causality model and tested on a set of real accidents. Computational results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which leads to a possible reduction of time and costs by up to 30%.
