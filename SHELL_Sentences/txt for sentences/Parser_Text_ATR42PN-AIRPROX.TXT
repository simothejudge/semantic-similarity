 3 the crew of flight iss1834 read back incorrectly the controller clearance as flightlevel fl110.

 6 at 13h50:19 hours the crew of iss1834 switched frequencies to rome acc, and reported:`` rome good afternoon iss1834, passing fl 7 2, climbing 1 1 0, inbound robet''.

 7 also, the rome acc controller did not notice the error in the cleared altitude of the flight iss1834.

 9 this clearance was immediately corrected by the rome acc to fl110 as result of the previous communication from pantelleria tower about the presence of flight iss1834 at flightlevel fl 100.

18 the tower controller in pantelleria and the controller of rome acc had the false assumption that iss1834 flight was actually climbing for the authorized level of fl100, while it was evident that the crew of the flight in question was executing a manoeuvre to climb up to fl110.
L#

19  this false belief first of controller of pantelleria tower and later of rome acc controller; associated with lack of vigilance in the exercise of the radar surveillance by rome acc cta officer; did not detect the climb beyond authorized limits of the iss1834, which was entering a flightlevel assigned to an opposite route flight yet.
